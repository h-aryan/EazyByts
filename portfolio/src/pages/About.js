          Hello! I'm Harsh Aryan, a passionate full-stack developer with a
          strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. I love
          building fast, responsive, and scalable web applications that solve
          real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
          My tech stack includes React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I'm
          also experienced in creating RESTful APIs, working with CMS platforms
          like Sanity, and designing elegant UIs with CSS and Tailwind.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
          Whether it's a dynamic portfolio site, a login-protected dashboard, or
          a backend authentication system, I enjoy every part of the
          processâ€”from idea to deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I actively participate in technical communities,
          organize events, and love to explore creative and impactful side
          projects.
        </p>
